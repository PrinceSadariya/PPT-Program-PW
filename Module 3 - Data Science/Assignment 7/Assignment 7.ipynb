    "**Right-Sizing Instances:** Analyze the resource requirements of your machine learning workloads and select cloud instances that match your specific needs. Avoid overprovisioning by choosing instance types with appropriate CPU, memory, and GPU configurations. Use cloud provider tools, such as AWS Cost Explorer or Azure Cost Management, to identify underutilized instances and resize or terminate them as necessary.\n",

    "**Spot Instances:** Utilize spot instances or preemptible VMs offered by cloud providers. These instances are available at a significantly lower cost compared to on-demand or reserved instances. Spot instances are ideal for fault-tolerant workloads or non-critical processes that can handle interruptions. Use them for tasks like data preprocessing, hyperparameter optimization, or training multiple model versions simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Auto Scaling:** Implement auto-scaling to dynamically adjust the number of instances based on workload demands. Configure scaling policies to automatically scale up during peak usage and scale down during periods of low demand. Auto-scaling helps optimize resource utilization and reduce costs by ensuring that you only pay for the resources you need at any given time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Storage Optimization:** Optimize storage costs by selecting appropriate storage types and configurations. Evaluate the data access patterns and frequency to choose the most cost-effective storage options. Utilize tiered storage services offered by cloud providers to automatically move infrequently accessed data to lower-cost storage tiers.\n",
